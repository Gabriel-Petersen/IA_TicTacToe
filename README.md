# IA_TicTacToe
A simple project containing two different algorithms of IAs to play TicTacToe without any (big) lib

With just mathematical concepts I have created this code with the only intention to train my "logical" and "mathematical" skills (no such TensorFlow, Numpy, scikit-learn or PyTorch)
The hole code is write in english, but the interaction with the user is entirely in portuguese (my mother-language)
It's not optimized and the heuristics are not well calibrated (The Neural Network is not even being "smart")
Feel free to test and rewrite in your own language and with your own heuristics

I've used an evolutional model to train the Neural Network without a data base, using the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to play against the subjects (and against the player if it wants)
